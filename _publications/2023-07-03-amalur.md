excerpt: ' In this work, we present a vision of how to bridge the traditional data integration (DI) techniques with the requirements of modern machine learning. We explore the possibilities of utilizing metadata obtained from data integration processes for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of ML models. Towards this direction, we analyze two common use cases over data silos, feature augmentation and federated learning.'

The increasing need for data trading across businesses nowadays has created a demand for data marketplaces. However, despite the intentions of both data providers and consumers, todayâ€™s data marketplaces remain mere data catalogs. We believe that marketplaces of the future require a set of value-added services, such as advanced search and discovery, that have been proposed in the database research community for years, but are not yet put to practice. With this paper, we report on the effort to engineer and develop an open-source modular data market platform to enable both entrepreneurs and researchers to setup and experiment with data marketplaces. To this end, we implemented and extended existing methods for data profiling, dataset search & discovery, and data recommendation.
