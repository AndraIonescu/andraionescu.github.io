into the practices of feature discovery on tabular data performed

Multiple works in data management research focus on automating the processes of data augmentation and feature discovery to
save users from having to perform these tasks manually. Yet, this
automation often leads to a disconnect with the users, as it fails to
consider the specific needs and preferences of the actual end-users
of data management systems for machine learning. To explore this
issue further, we conducted 19 semi-structured, think-aloud usecase studies based on a scenario in which data specialists were
tasked with augmenting a base table with additional features to
train a machine learning model. In this paper, we share key insights
into the practices of feature discovery on tabular data performed
by real-world data specialists derived from our user study. Our
research uncovered differences between the user assumptions reported in the literature and the actual practices, as well as some
areas where literature and real-world practices align.
