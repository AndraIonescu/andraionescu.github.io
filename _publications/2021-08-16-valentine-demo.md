excerpt: 'In this demonstration we present its functionalities and enhancements: i) a scalable system, with a user-centric GUI, that enables the fabrication of datasets and the evaluation of matching methods on schema matching scenarios tailored to the scope of tabular dataset discovery, ii) a scalable holistic matching system that can receive tabular datasets from heterogeneous sources and provide with similarity scores among their columns, in order to facilitate modern procedures in data lakes, such as dataset discovery.'

Our recently proposed Valentine is the first system to offer an
open-source experiment suite to organize, execute and orchestrate
large-scale matching experiments. In this demonstration we present
its functionalities and enhancements: i) a scalable system, with a
user-centric GUI, that enables the fabrication of datasets and the
evaluation of matching methods on schema matching scenarios
tailored to the scope of tabular dataset discovery, ii) a scalable
holistic matching system that can receive tabular datasets from
heterogeneous sources and provide with similarity scores among
their columns, in order to facilitate modern procedures in data lakes,
such as dataset discovery.
