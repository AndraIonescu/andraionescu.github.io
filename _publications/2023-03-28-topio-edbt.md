collection: publications
permalink: /publication/topio-demo
excerpt: 'The increasing need for data trading has created a high demand for data marketplaces. These marketplaces require a set of valueadded services, such as advanced search and discovery, that have been proposed in the database research community for years, but are yet to be put to practice. In this paper we propose to demonstrate the Topio Marketplace, an open-source data market platform that facilitates the search, exploration, discovery and augmentation of data assets. To support filtering, searching and discovery of data assets, we developed methods to extract and visualise a variety of metadata, as well as methods to discover related assets and mechanism to augment them. This paper aims at presenting these methods with a real deployment of the Topio marketplace, comprising hundreds of open and proprietary datasets.'
