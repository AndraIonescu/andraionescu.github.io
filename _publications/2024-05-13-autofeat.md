permalink: /publication/autofeat
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a novel ranking-based feature discovery
method called AutoFeat. Given a base table with a target
label, AutoFeat explores multi-hop, transitive join paths to
find relevant features in order to augment the base table with
additional features, ultimately leading to increased accuracy of
an ML model. AutoFeat is general: it evaluates the predictive
power of features without the need to train an ML model, ranking
join paths using the concepts of relevance and redundancy.'

This paper proposes a novel ranking-based feature discovery
method called AutoFeat. Given a base table with a target
label, AutoFeat explores multi-hop, transitive join paths to
find relevant features in order to augment the base table with
additional features, ultimately leading to increased accuracy of
an ML model. AutoFeat is general: it evaluates the predictive
power of features without the need to train an ML model, ranking
join paths using the concepts of relevance and redundancy.
Our experiments on real-world open data show that AutoFeat
is efficient: it can find features of high predictive power on
data lakes with an increased number of dataset joinability
relationships 5x-44x faster than baseline approaches. In addition,
AutoFeat is effective, improving accuracy by 16% on average
compared to the baseline approaches, even in noisy, uncurated
data lakes.
