excerpt: 'As data is produced at an unprecedented rate, the need and ex-pectation to make it easily available for the end-users is growing. Dataset Discovery has become an important subject in the data management community, as it represents the means of providing the data to the user and fulfilling an information need. Since the end-user is the one that needs the information and knows what type of information to look for, little has been done to involve the user in the discovery process.'

As data is produced at an unprecedented rate, the need and ex-pectation to make it easily available for the end-users is growing.

Since the end-user is the one that needs the information and knows what type of information to look for, little has been done to involve the user in the discovery process.
