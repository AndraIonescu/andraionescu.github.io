excerpt: 'Data science workflows often require extracting, preparing and integrating data from multiple data sources. This is a cumbersome and slow process: most of the times, data scientists prepare data in a data processing system or a data lake, and export it as a table, in order for it to be consumed by a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. Recent advances in the area of factorized ML, allow us to push down certain linear algebra (LA) operators, executing them closer to the data sources. With this work, we revisit classic data integration (DI) systems and see how these fit into modern data lakes that are meant to support LA as a first-class citizen.'

Data science workflows often require extracting, preparing and
integrating data from multiple data sources. This is a cumbersome
and slow process: most of the times, data scientists prepare data in
a data processing system or a data lake, and export it as a table, in
order for it to be consumed by a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm.
Recent advances in the area of factorized ML, allow us to push down
certain linear algebra (LA) operators, executing them closer to the
data sources. With this work, we revisit classic data integration
(DI) systems and see how these fit into modern data lakes that are
meant to support LA as a first-class citizen.
