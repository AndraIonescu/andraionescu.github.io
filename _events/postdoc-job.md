The time has come to say goodbye to the Netherlands.
After nearly 8 years, NL has been my home, a place that has shaped me personally and professionally. 
I am incredibly grateful for the wonderful people I’ve met and the experiences that have enriched my journey. I will always cherish them!

So, where to next?

I am thrilled to announce that I’ll be moving to Sweden!
I’ve accepted a postdoc position at KTH in Stockholm, where I will be working at the intersection of Data Management and Healthcare Informatics.
My research will focus on exploring knowledge graphs for clinical data harmonisation, collaborating with Paris Carbone, Jayanth Raghothama and Sebastiaan Meijer. 

I am beyond excited for this next chapter, and I’m looking forward to embracing new challenges, exploring Sweden and meeting new people.
