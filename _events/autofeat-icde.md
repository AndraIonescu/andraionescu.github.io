In May, I attended [ICDE](https://icde2024.github.io/) in [Utrecht, The Netherlands](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q7tFG5jKhjPzjosc8), where I presented my research paper on automated feature discovery - [AutoFeat](/publication/autofeat). 

This year marked my first time attending ICDE in person, and it turned out to be a truly memorable experience. 
The conference was held in The Netherlands, which made it even more special as itâ€™s the country I currently call home.  

It was heartwarming to see so many people from around the world come together here, getting a chance to experience the beauty and charm of The Netherlands. 
We were especially fortunate with the weather, as May greeted us with warm, sunny days that added to the nice atmosphere.  

Another highlight was celebrating the attendance of the entire data management group from TU Delft. 
It was wonderful to share this experience with my colleagues and see our collective work and presence at the conference recognized.

Here are some photos from the conference:
