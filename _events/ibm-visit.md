During my summer trip to NYC, I had the incredible opportunity to visit the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, thanks to an invitation from Dr. Horst Samulowitz.  

Stepping into such a historic and iconic space was a privilege, made even more special by the chance to see their quantum computer in person. 
The experience felt perfectly timed, especially after attending the [quantum computing tutorial at ICDE](https://icde2024.github.io/tutorials.html#tutorial7). 

Here are some photos from IBM:
