In October, I attended [CIKM](https://cikm2024.org/) in [Boise, Idaho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XenF5vgMg3o1wzhr7), where I presented [my demo](/publication/hil-autofeat), the human-in-the-loop version of [AutoFeat](/publication/autofeat). 

This was my first time at CIKM, and I was pleasantly surprised by the content. 
The organisation has been quite good (with the exception of demos), and overall I had a great time. 
I didn't expect to see such a diverse range of topics and audience: people from IR, Recommender systems, databases, ML, bias and fairness, and many more. 

Thank you all for making this conference such a beautiful and memorable experience! 

Here are some photos from the conference:
