In June, I attended [SIGMOD](https://2024.sigmod.org/) in [Santiago, Chile](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QaH4ELZC5ZLqgVAb6), where I presented the key insights from a user-study with data professionals from the industry on their workflow to create training datasets for ML applications. 

I presented my work at the [HILDA workshop](https://hilda.io/2024/) co-located with SIGMOD. This was my first time attending HILDA and I was pleasantly surprised to see similarities between my work and the other works presented at the workshop. I also had to opportunity to interact with Prof. Rennee Miller, and many others distinguished members of the data management adn database community, such as Prof. C. Mohan. 

Thank you all for making this conference such a beautiful and memorable experience!
