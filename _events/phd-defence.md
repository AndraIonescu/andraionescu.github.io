&#127891; The beginning of 2025 marks the end of my PhD journey &#127891;

Monday, 13th January at 17:30, I publicly defended my PhD thesis, titled ["Feature Discovery for Data-Centric AI"](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:433071e6-38d1-4442-b73b-be4e0c086a93) and obtained the title of Doctor.  

I would like to extend my gratitude to the committee members, Angela Bonifati, Sebastian Schelter, Paul Groth and Alessandro Bozzon for creating an amazing discussion and debate. I would like to thank my supervisors, Asterios Katsifodimos, Rihan Hai and Geert-Jan Houben for their immense support during these years and for teaching me so much. 

Many many thanks to my paranymphs, Alisa Rieger and Garrett Allen, for their support and friendship, and to my husband, Alexandru BÄƒlan for always being by my side. 

A huge thank you to everybody who watched the defence in person or online, I feel incredibly grateful for all the support I've received.

The experience was truly unforgettable, I had an amazing time, and I will remember it forever. To the next adventure &#129346;
