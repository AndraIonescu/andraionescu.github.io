### Open for work 

&#128226; I am actively seeking new opportunities where I can contribute my expertise in data engineering research to drive impactful projects. If you know of any roles or collaborations that align with my skills, Iâ€™d love to connect! &#128226;


### About me 

I am a research scientist with a background in software engineering. My research is focused on data engineering approaches for creating high-quality training datasets for machine learning models, mainly focusing on decision trees. 

My professional expertise is built on 5 years of experience in full-stack software development across various industries. I have a [PhD in Computer Science](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:433071e6-38d1-4442-b73b-be4e0c086a93) from Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, under the supervision of [Asterios Katsifodimos](https://asterios.katsifodimos.com/) and [Rihan Hai](https://rihanhai.com/). My academic credentials also include a [Master of Science](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:9f8056e6-cfdf-4240-99e3-5f45947d1fa7) in Computer Science, specialising in Data Science, from the same university and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Politehnica University of Bucharest, Romania. 

I am an active community member and I have received the &#127942; Best Demonstration Award at [EDBT 2023](http://edbticdt2023.cs.uoi.gr/?contents=awards_demo_edbt.html) &#127942;.
