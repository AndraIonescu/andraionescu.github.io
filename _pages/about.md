I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, working on a cross-disciplinary project between the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and the School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology, and Health (CBH). In collaboration with [Paris Carbone](https://people.kth.se/~parisc/), [Jayanth Raghothama](https://www.jayanthr.net/about/), and [Sebastiaan Meijer](https://www.kth.se/profile/smeijer), we are working on [Mediverse](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/project/mediverse-multimodal-clinical-exploration-and-search-on-a-single-graph/), a Digital Futures research project. The goal of Mediverse is to provide a platform for multi-modal clinical data harmonisation for secondary reuse through unified graph-based representations, aiming to transform clinical decision-making and information retrieval.

I have a [PhD in Computer Science](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:433071e6-38d1-4442-b73b-be4e0c086a93) from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, under the supervision of [Asterios Katsifodimos](https://asterios.katsifodimos.com/) and [Rihan Hai](https://rihanhai.com/). My research was focused on feature discovery in data-centric AI, with the goal of creating high-quality training datasets for machine learning models, mainly focusing on decision trees. 

My academic credentials also include a [Master of Science](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:9f8056e6-cfdf-4240-99e3-5f45947d1fa7) in Computer Science, specialising in Data Science, from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Politehnica University of Bucharest, Romania. 

I am an active member of the database and data management community, and I have received the &#127942; Best Demonstration Award at [EDBT 2023](http://edbticdt2023.cs.uoi.gr/?contents=awards_demo_edbt.html) &#127942;.
