Hey, thanks for dropping by! I'm Andra Ionescu, a bit of a data geek and machine learning enthusiast.
This year my journey at TU Delft is coming to an end, so I am ***open for work*** &#129395; 

What I've Been Up To
======
I spent some quality time at TU Delft, The Netherlands, working towards obtaining my Ph.D. degree after doing my master's there too.
I got my bachelor's from Politehnica University in Bucharest, Romania. 

Real-World Experience
======
I have 4 years of experience working as a software engineer (back-end, front-end and full-stack), and another 4 years working as a researcher. 
I started the transition to the research world with my research internship which involved diving into the world of fintech, figuring out how to match up different data sources.

Talking About My Work
======
Ever heard of podcasts? Well, I got to be on one, talking about my work on data market platforms. 
Plus, I've written some papers that got a thumbs-up at big conferences: best demonstration award at EDBT 2023. 

My Superpowers
======
I love to organise, plan and *document* pretty much everything. Other super-powers include and are not limited to: collaboration, time and project management, great communication and presentation skills. 

What I'm Into
=======
My research is like solving mysteries in the world of data. I'm curious about finding datasets, making datasets better, and creating training datasets for machine learning.

Beyond Work
=======
But life isn't just about work, right? I'm all about giving back. 
I've been helping out with projects that support women in science and I've also organized cool events for researchers. 
I love food: cooking, baking, eating, and maybe in the future even growing some food on my own. 

Let's Hang Out!
=======
So, that's a bit about me. Feel free to wander around, learn more about what I do, and drop me a message.
