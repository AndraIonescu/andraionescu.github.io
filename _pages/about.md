I am a research scientist with a background in software engineering. My research is focused on data engineering approaches for creating high-quality training datasets for machine learning models, mainly focusing on decision trees. 

My professional expertise is built on 5 years of experience in full-stack software development across various industries. I have a [PhD in Computer Science](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:433071e6-38d1-4442-b73b-be4e0c086a93) from Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, under the supervision of [Asterios Katsifodimos](https://asterios.katsifodimos.com/) and [Rihan Hai](https://rihanhai.com/). My academic credentials also include a [Master of Science](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:9f8056e6-cfdf-4240-99e3-5f45947d1fa7) in Computer Science, specialising in Data Science, from the same university and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Politehnica University of Bucharest, Romania.
